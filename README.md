# Voltage

An oscillographic programming library for Arduino-compatible microcontrollers. Development is currently being done with [Teensy 3.6](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy36.html).

## How to use

1. Connect Teensy's DAC0 and DAC1 pins and GND to oscilloscope's X and Y inputs.
2. Install the library by copying the _Voltage_ directory to Arduino _libraries_ folder (e.g. _~/Documents/Arduino/libraries/_ on macOS)
